\section{Assignments}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assemble all the sections of the macro and add a dialog box at the beginning to have an easy access to all the detection parameters.
 
\item Test the macro on the complete field of view (\textbf{FISH-MIP-Confocal63x.tif} ) or a larger image (\textbf{FISH-MIP-Widefild20x-Montage.tif} ) montaged from widefield images. In each case adjust the parameters to get a satisfying detection of the nuclei and the spots.

\textbf{\underline{Hint}} : Indicative detection parameters (confocal/widefield): Nucleus smooth (12/5), Nucleus sensitivity (-0.05/-0.05), Spot smoothing (3/2), Spot background radius (5/4), Spot level for all channels (25/25).

\item Log the frequency (number of nuclei over total number of nuclei detected) for some specific user defined spot combinations. You should find that there are two large populations of normal male and female spermatozoids in the confocal dataset (1/0/1 and 0/1/1) while a majority of nuclei have a single spot in each channel in the widefield dataset (1/1/1) and many have anomalies.

\textbf{\underline{Solution}} : A complete macro is provided as solution to the 3 assignments: \textbf{code/solutions/FISHNucleiAnalyzer.ijm} .
