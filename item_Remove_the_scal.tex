\subsection{Exercise \arabic{exerciseCounter}}
\stepcounter{exerciseCounter}
Create a macro (from the recorder) that performs the steps 3 to 6 of the previous workflow.\footnote{If you are using OSX, it sometimes happens that copying from the command recorder and pasting it to the script editor does not work. In that case, try using right mouse click (or control-click) to copy recorded commands. If this still does not work, then click the ``Create'' button at the top-right corner.}. You can find the solution to the exercises as a complete macro in \textbf{code/solutions/module3\_01.ijm} .

\underline{\textbf{Note} }: We assume that the original hyperstack is already open when the macro is run.
