\section{Step 1: Initialization---a short warm-up}

\subsection{Workflow}

In Fiji, perform the steps described in this section with the command recorder open and create a macro from the recorder.
We will use the image \textbf{Small.tif} .\\

This hyperstack (4 channels) is a crop view from of a single field of a confocal dataset.
Each image is a maximum intensity projection, per channel, of the original data. 
The first image is a staining for the nuclei, all subsequent images are acquired in the fluorescence channels of the FISH stainings.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the image file in Fiji by
    \ijmenu{[File > Open...]} or by drag and drop of the file on the Fiji bar.
    
    \item Examine the hyperstack using the stack browser (slider).
    
    \item Split Channels to get independent images for each fluorescence channel.
        \ijmenu{[Images > Color > Split Channels]}
    \item Remove the scale of the opened images by 
        \ijmenu{[Analyze > Set Scale\ldots]}. 
        Use the same settings as in Fig.~\ref{fig:init}:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item\textbf{distance} and \textbf{known distance} to "0" and  
            \item\textbf{Pixel aspect ratio} to "1".  
            \item The \textbf{Unit length} should be "pixel". 
            \item  \textbf{Global} should be ticked so that the settings apply to all images (and subsequently opened images).

        \end{itemize}

        Alternatively, press the "click to remove scale" button. 
    
    \item Set Binary Options 
    \ijmenu{[Process > Binary > Options...]}.
    Make sure "Iterations" and "Count" are both set to 1 and that "Black background" and "Pad edges when eroding" are NOT ticked. EDM output should be set to overwrite. These settings correspond to ImageJ default settings and it is a good habit to always set them to predictable values at the beginning of a macro since they control the behavior of many commands that are commonly used. 
    
    \item Set Measurements 
    \ijmenu{[Analyze > Set Measurements...]}.

\begin{itemize}
        \item\textbf{Area,} 
        \item\textbf{Mean gray value,} 
        \item and \textbf{Shape Descriptors} 
        
        \item\textbf{Redirect} should be set to "None" 
        \item\textbf{Decimal places} should be 2 or greater.  
    
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
