\item Dilate
    \ijmenu{[Process >  Binary > Dilate]}.
    From Fig.~\ref{fig:NucOverlayBeforeDilate} we can see that the detected boundaries mostly follow the contours of the nuclei but that they sometimes overlap with them. This may become a problem later on when intending to detect a FISH spot close to the boundary of a nucleus. This problem can be mitigated by enlarging the segmented nuclei by morphological dilation (see section \textbf{Morphology} in Module 1). Each round of dilation enlarges the objects by one pixel, several dilations can be performed sequentially.
